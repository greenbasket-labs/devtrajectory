## What is DevTrajectory?

DevTrajectory is a research and visualization project that explores
how developer impact evolves over time using **observable builder signals**.

It does not rank developers.
It does not assign scores.
It does not make hiring decisions.

Instead, it focuses on **trajectory**.

---

## Why?

Years of experience do not always reflect real-world impact.

- A junior developer with one real project can outperform
  a senior developer with years of inactivity.
- Builders grow in bursts, pauses, returns, and breakthroughs.

DevTrajectory makes this movement visible.

## What are Builder Signals?

Examples include:
- Deployed smart contracts
- Applications with real users
- Open-source contributions
- Hackathon submissions
- Protocol or infrastructure integrations

Signals are **public, verifiable actions**.

---

## How It Works (Current)

- Static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- User enters signals
- A snapshot and movement concept is visualized
- No backend
- No tracking
- No storage

This is intentional.

---

## What This Is Not

- ❌ A ranking system
- ❌ A reputation score
- ❌ A hiring platform
- ❌ A tokenized value system

---

## Future Exploration

- Time-based views (year / month / week)
- On-chain signal verification
- Privacy-aware attestations
- DAO and protocol signal consumption

---

## Status

Early-stage research project.  
Built in public.  
Subject to iteration.

---

Built by builders, for builders.
