# DevTrajectory  
**Builder signals over time, not resumes.**

DevTrajectory is a research-driven framework for observing how developers grow through real work, public contribution, and impact — rather than job titles, years of experience, or social clout.

This project explores a simple idea:  
> Developer value is not static. It moves.

---

## Problem

Today, developers are commonly evaluated using:
- Years of experience
- Job titles
- Company logos
- Online visibility

These signals often fail to reflect:
- Actual shipped work
- Real users served
- Open-source contribution quality
- Growth over time

As a result:
- Junior developers with real impact are overlooked  
- Senior developers with low output remain overvalued  
- Builders are incentivized to signal status instead of building useful things  

---

## Core Idea

**DevTrajectory** introduces a *trajectory-based* way of thinking about developer value.

Instead of ranking developers absolutely, it focuses on **movement over time**, similar to how markets observe price trends rather than labels.

> Think charts, not titles.

The goal is not to judge — but to **observe growth**.

## What This Is / What This Is Not

### What This Is
- A research framework
- A public-good idea
- A builder-first visibility concept
- A neutral signal aggregation model
- A long-term experiment in fair developer evaluation

### What This Is Not
- ❌ Not a hiring platform (by design, for now)
- ❌ Not a leaderboard
- ❌ Not a reputation token
- ❌ Not a gatekeeping system
- ❌ Not a ranking of “best developers”

---

## Builder Signals (Conceptual)

DevTrajectory considers **signals**, not credentials.  
Examples include:

- Public deployments (testnet or mainnet)
- Open-source contributions
- Hackathon submissions
- Grant milestones
- Documentation written
- Tools or services used by real people
- Research artifacts shared publicly

No single signal dominates.  
Signals compound over time.

---

## Trajectory Model (Illustrative)

Instead of ranks, developers may be described as:

- **Emerging** — early public work, learning in the open  
- **Growing** — consistent output and experimentation  
- **Proven** — sustained delivery and community value  
- **Sustained** — long-term contribution and reliability  

These are **descriptive**, not competitive.

---

## Why This Matters

- Rewards real building, not noise
- Protects junior developers from being dismissed unfairly
- Keeps senior developers accountable through output
- Encourages long-term contribution over short-term hype
- Aligns with Web3 values: openness, verifiability, permissionless growth

A junior developer with one meaningful, widely used project can outperform a senior developer with years of inactivity — and that should be visible.

---

## Status

- 🟡 Concept & research phase  
- 🟡 No backend  
- 🟡 No data collection  
- 🟡 No monetization  
- 🟡 No on-chain logic  

This repository exists to document the idea clearly and responsibly.

---

## Future Directions (Optional, Non-Binding)

These are **possibilities**, not commitments:

- Client-side simulations (JS-only)
- On-chain attestations (opt-in)
- DAO or grant ecosystem integrations
- Hiring use-cases *only if demanded by the ecosystem*

Restraint is intentional.

## Design Philosophy

- Favor transparency over authority
- Favor growth over labels
- Favor builders over resumes
- Favor public learning over private signaling
